When we retrieve a value from a dictionary using the key as in OS.environ[fruit] and the key isn't present, we get an error. If we use a getMethod instead, we can specify what value should be returned if the key isn't present

Basically, the getMethod allows us to specify a default value when the key that we're looking for isn't in the dictionary.
