#### Exercise - 1
We'll be working with a log file named syslog.log, which contains logs related to ticky.

You can view this file using:
cat syslog.log

The log lines follow a pattern similar to the ones we've seen before. Something like this:

	May 27 11:45:40 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO: Created ticket [#1234] (username)
	Jun 1 11:06:48 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR: Connection to DB failed (username)
